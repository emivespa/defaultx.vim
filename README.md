# `defaultx.vim`

some of vim default colorschemes, modified to work for both dark and light
backgrounds.

This is achieved by using
the normal (darker) variants of the 3 brightest colors (green, yellow and cyan)
and
the bright variants of the 3 darkest colors (red, blue and magenta).

Some other notes:
* brown becomes yellow
* GUI support completely removed
